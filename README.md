# RC4 Stream Cipher using Python 2.7

Run RC4 encryption using the default plaintext and key by running ` pyhton rc4.py`


The keystream generated by the RC4 is distinguishable from perfectly random stream as it is biased in certain sequences.

To see that the second byte is biased towards 0 run ` python rc4.py c -o <output_filename> `
